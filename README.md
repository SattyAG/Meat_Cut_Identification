# Meat_Cut_Identification
This is a Meat_Cur Identification Task...

Computer Vision (CV) is one of the sexiest fields in artificial intelligence. There are different application of CV such as face recognition, anamoly detection in images, disease recognition etc. The CV has a huge application in meat industries as well to control the quality, finding adulteration, and monitoring the freshness of the meats. While much work has been done for quality controlling, very few or negligible work can be found in automating the packaging and labelling of the meat products. Meat industries still depends upon the operators for such tasks. In this project, the aim is to identify meat cuts using deep learning to automate the meat-cut labelling.
