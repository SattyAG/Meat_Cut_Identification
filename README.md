# Meat_Cut_Identification
This is a Meat_Cur Identification Task...

# Overview
Computer Vision (CV) is one of the most advanced fields in artificial intelligence. There are different application of CV such as face recognition, anamoly detection in images, disease recognition etc. In this project, I have examined the different methodologies of Deep Learning to classify the 5 different meat cuts and also tackle the problem of imbalanced nature of the dataset by augmenting the images.
